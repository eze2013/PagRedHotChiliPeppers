                <p>About this planet there is something I know <br>
                    There's a very big difference between above and below <br>
                    A friend, foe or bro, leave your body on the floor <br>
                    Let your spirit fly away like the soul of a crow <br>
                    Here above land, man has laid his plan <br>
                    And yes, it does include the Ku Klux Klan <br>
                    We got a government so twisted and bent <br>
                    Bombs, tanks and guns is how our money is spent <br>
                    We got V.D., heroin, greed and prostitution <br>
                    Tension, aggravation, L. Ron Hubbard solution <br>
                    Not to mention hard-core chemical pollution <br>
                    If you think a different way, you're in a mental institution <br>
                    And that's a heart felt shame <br>
                    'Cause everyone's crazy, everyone's the same <br>
                    So why should only Larry, Curly and Moe be to blame? <br>
                    Time now to take you to a different place <br>
                    Where peace lovin' whales flow through liquid outer space <br>
                    A groovin' and a gliddin' as graceful as lace <br>
                    A never losing touch with the ocean's embrace <br>
                    Diviner than the dolphin, that there is none <br>
                    'Cause dolphins just like to have a lot of fun <br>
                    No one tells 'em how their life is run <br>
                    And no one points at them with a gun <br>
                    They have a lot of love for every living creature <br>
                    The smile of a dolphin is a built in feature <br>
                    They be movin' in schools but everyone's the teacher <br>
                    Someday Mr. Dolphin, I know I'm going to meet you <br>
                    Back to the land of the police man <br>
                    Where he does whatever he says he can <br>
                    Including hating you because you're a Jew <br>
                    Or beating black ass and that's nothing new <br>
                    A trigger happy cops, they just like to brawl <br>
                    They use guns, clubs, gas, but that's not all <br>
                    They got puke, ridden prisons and sex sick jails <br>
                    Fuck the poor, if you're rich you pay the bail <br>
                    So support your police, support your local wars <br>
                    That's the way to open economic doors <br>
                    Why do we do it? 'Cause the president's a whore <br>
                    We assume the position to sell the ammunition <br>
                    What the fuck? It's the American tradition <br>
                    Along with going fishin', apple pies in the kitchen <br>
                    Isn't it bitchin' seein' dead men in ditches?</p>

                    You could tell he was strong <br>
                    He wore a cold paisley jacket <br>
                    And a hellified ass <br>
                    And between his legs was a sweat young lass <br>
                    He threw a hundred women up against the wall <br>
                    And he swore to fear that he’d love them all <br>
                    But by the time he got to 99 he had to stop <br>
                    ‘Cause that’s when he thought <br>
